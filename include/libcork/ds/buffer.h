/**
 * @brief A resizable binary buffer.
 *
 * This class is not reference counted; we assume that there's a single
 * owner of the buffer.  The contents of a cork_buffer_t are fully
 * mutable.  If you want to turn the buffer into something that's safe
 * to pass between threads, you can use the @ref cork_buffer_to_slice or
 * @ref cork_buffer_to_managed_buffer functions to create an immutable
 * managed wrapper around the buffer.
 *
 * You can read the contents of the buffer by accessing the @ref buf and
 * @ref size fields directly; however, you should only use the class's
 * method to modify the contents, since they take care of automatically
 * resizing the underlying buffer when necessary.
 *
 * @note Note that this class always creates its own copy of any data
 * added to the buffer; there aren't any methods for wrapping existing
 * buffers without copying.  If you want to do that, you need the @ref
 * cork_managed_buffer_t class.
