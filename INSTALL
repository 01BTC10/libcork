Installation instructions
=========================

The LIBRARY_NAME library is written in ANSI C.  It uses Waf as its
build manager.


Prerequisite libraries
----------------------

To build LIBRARY_NAME, you need the following libraries installed on
your system:

  * pkg-config
  * glib-2.0
  * check (http://check.sourceforge.net)
  * [ADD OTHERS AS NEEDED]


Building from source
--------------------

The LIBRARY_NAME library uses Waf as its build manager.  In most
cases, you should be able to build the source code using the
following:

    $ ./waf configure --prefix=$PREFIX
    $ ./waf -p
    $ ./waf -p build_tests
    $ ./waf test
    $ ./waf install

You might have to run the last command using sudo, if you need
administrative privileges to write to the $PREFIX directory.
